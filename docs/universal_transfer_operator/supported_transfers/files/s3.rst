Transfer to AWS S3 as destination dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
User can transfer data to AWS S3 as destination as from following sources dataset:

#. :ref:`table`

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/universal_transfer_operator/constants.py
       :language: python
       :start-after: [START database]
       :end-before: [END database]

#. :ref:`file`

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/universal_transfer_operator/constants.py
       :language: python
       :start-after: [START filelocation]
       :end-before: [END filelocation]

Following transfer modes are supported:

1. :ref:`non_native`
    Following is an example of non-native transfers between Google cloud storage to AWS S3 using non-native transfers:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../../example_dags/example_universal_transfer_operator.py
       :language: python
       :start-after: [START transfer_non_native_gs_to_s3]
       :end-before: [END transfer_non_native_gs_to_s3]
